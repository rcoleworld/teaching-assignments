# Introduction To Coding
## To learn the basics
Here is harvard's [CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW). To get good at basics, it is a good place to start. These lectures will take a while so take your time but try to follow along with the materials linked in the description.

Here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) on basic python. I know the course is long but you can watch these over the next few weeks. Do not feel overwelmed because there aren't any due dates.

## My Philosopy On Solving Problems
1. **Understand the problem.** Do this BEFORE you even touch your keyboard. What problem are we trying to solve? This process includes drawing diagrams on paper that can help visualize the problem.

2. **Come up with a rough solution.** After you have understood the problem come up with a rough solution that describes the algorithm (you will learn with this is in the CS50 course or you can just google it) that you will need to solve the problem.

3. **Translate your rough solution to code**

4. ***Optimize your code** to make your code run faster and more readable
