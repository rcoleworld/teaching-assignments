#
# Assignment 1: Complete the following function. Do not modify 
# anything other than what is labeled for you to change.
#
# Goal: Complete the function below. This function will add together
# all of the numbers from 1 to num
# 
# sum_to_n(3) will output 5 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
# sum_to_n(5) will output 14 because  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
#
# Your output from this code should be identical to the file output.txt
#

def sum_to_n(num: int):
    # Start coding below this point.

    # Don't modify anything past this point
